I strongly suggest downloading this [PDF](https://web.mit.edu/~yczeng/Public/WORKBOOK%201%20FULL.pdf). It offers great AP practice topic by topic. Each topic has a bunch of practice multiple choice questions and FRQ's.
​

This is a [playlist of Physic videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0o_zxa4K1BWrOyLXkHSZD4bw3yVKMwi8)  by the Organic Chemistry Tutor. These videos are great if you need conceptual understanding or simply want to have a better grasp of the topic. It's almost like you're learning in school, but at your own pace. I honestly couldn't have made through Physics without him!
​

Here's [another great website](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-physics/) with step by step conceptual information and extra practice problems.
​

You probably already know about [ Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/ap-physics-1), but it's great for AP students as it follows the college board outline and has content for each unit. Unfortunately, there isn't a section for Physics C Mechanics, but the info for Physic I should be just as helpful.
​

This is the [AP Physics 2020 review by Princeton book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Physics-Exam-College-Preparation/dp/0525568328/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2Z291SWQSUM9A&dchild=1&keywords=ap+physics+c&qid=1586142868&sprefix=ap+phy%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-2) . This book covers not only AP Physics C, but also electricity and magnetism. I strongly suggest getting this book if you consider continuing in Physics or decide to take Physics E&M.
