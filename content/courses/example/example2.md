Not too bad right? 

Now let's move on to two - dimensional motion. This is a little trickier as it deals with motion in two directions (horizontal AND vertical). That might sound confusing, but don't worry, it's just as simple as one - dimensional motion.

What EXACTLY is two - dimensional motion? 

Think of a parabolic motion, something that goes up and comes back down. Some common examples of parabolic or projectile motion include trampolines, or cannons, or even kicking a soccer ball. What's important to note, however, is these motions have both a horizontal and vertical component. In other words, while the object is moving up, it is also moving sideways.

​What I learned from taking Physics is always remember your units, but more importantly write down the variables you are given, and organize yourself so you know what you are solving for. One thing that really helped me during this unit was making a table; I found this was the easiest way to organize the information in the problem.

The above diagrams are important. It should help you understand the motion, specifically the velocity, of the object as it is released from the projectile. The velocity has vertical and horizontal components. This is super important! As the diagram shows, there is usually an angle; use this angle to find the velocity.

For example, if you were given a scenario in which a ball was launched with an initial velocity of 10 m/s at an angle of 75 degrees.

 10 sin (75) = Vo vertical

 10 cos (75) = Vo horizontal

Another thing to notice is that at the very top of the projectile the horizontal acceleration is 0. This is why when filling out our handy - dandy table, we label a = 0. This is only for the horizontal component. For the vertical component, however, acceleration is always 9.8 or gravity.

This may be a lot to take in, but it will get easier with the examples.

Let's try some practice problems.

## Problem 1
Katrina throws her mother's vase with an initial velocity of 4.2 m/s at an angle of 85 degrees. It lands. outside 3.4m below the height from which it was thrown.

a) Determine how long the vase was in the air. 

b) How far from Katrina does the vase land?

​

First, start by making the two-column table and fill in what you already know.

|`Vertical`        |   `Horizontal`|
|------------------| ------------- |
|o = 4.2sin(85)    |    Vo = 4.2cos(85)   |        
|Vf = 60 m/s       |    Vf =   |
|a = 9.8           |    a = 0  |
|t=                |    t =   |
|ΔY = 3.4 m        |    ΔX=   |



It is easy to solve for the time first, so let's go ahead and do that.

​Since you have the most known variables for the vertical columns, it is easiest to solve for that. Keep in mind the time will be the same for both the vertical and horizontal columns. Plugin your numbers from the vertical column into an equation that will help you solve for the time, I used equation #3 as shown on the formula sheet above. 

ΔX = Vo t + 0.5a t^2

3.4 = 4.2sin(85) t + 0.5 (9.8) t^2

t = 1.36 s

Now, with the time, we can solve for the horizontal displacement. 

I used the same equation, but this time instead of using the numbers from the vertical column, use the numbers from the horizontal column. 

ΔX = 0.50 m

Try this one yourself

## Problem 2
Andy uses a trampoline to jump over a 12.0 m flag. The trampoline is 6.9m from the base of the pole. Determine the time it takes for him to reach the top.

You should get 

t = 1.565 s

If you didn't get these answers, try going back to the problem and reading it carefully. Make sure to write out the variables you already have and the ones you are trying to solve for. Draw a picture if it helps!

Here's another one!

## Problem 3
A projectile is fired with an initial speed of 65.2 m/s at an angle of 34.5 degrees.

    a) Determine the total time in the air

    b) Determine the total horizontal distance

You should get 

t = 7.537 s

ΔX = 404.986 m
