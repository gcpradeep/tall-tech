To begin with, we will focus on one - dimensional kinematics.

Let's try some practice problems.

## Problem 1
A motorcycle speeds up from 24 m/s to 60 m/s and travels a distance of 500m within that period. How long does it take to travel this distance?

Now there are two equations you will use when solving this problem. The question is asking us to find t (time). First list out your known variables.

Vo = 24 m/s                 
Vf = 60 m/s                 
ΔX = 500m

t = ?,  a = ?


Notice how we don't know acceleration or time.

Let's start by solving for acceleration.

Plug your numbers into the equation ( I used equation #2 as shown on the formula sheet to the right)

a = 3.024 m/s^2

Now using the acceleration, we can solve for time. Once again plug your known numbers into an equation (I used equation #1)

t = 11.905 s

Try this one by yourself.

## Problem 2
A car accelerates from rest to 48 m/s in 6 seconds. Find the average and acceleration and how far the car traveled during this time period. 

You should get 

a = 8 m/s^2

ΔX = 144 m

If you didn't get these answers, try going back to the problem and reading it carefully. Make sure to write out the variables you already have and the ones you are trying to solve for. Trust me you will thank me in the end!
