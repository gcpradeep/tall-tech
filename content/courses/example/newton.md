This unit is one of the longer units, so throughout my explanations, I will be adding a few videos that thoroughly explain the topic and give you a better conceptual understanding. These are all the videos I watched when I was learning the topic, so I know they are helpful, and therefore I strongly suggest you watch them.

Newton's Three Laws.     * Memorize these! *
{{% /alert %}}

1) An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

2) The acceleration of an object is dependent upon the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object.

3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

We will mainly focus on Newton's Second Law during this unit. Go ahead and watch this video; make sure you are taking notes and try the practice problems!!

## Steps to solving Newton's 2nd Law Problem.

1) Read the problem and pick out the variables you have and the variables you need to find.

2) Draw a Free Body Diagram and label the components.

3) Separate you X components and Y components and set them both equal to ma (mass) * (acceleration)

4) Solve for the missing variable

## Free Body Diagrams
This video goes over free body diagrams and how to draw them for different scenarios. You will see this concept throughout Physics, so make sure you thoroughly look through this and review it. Try the practice problems. Try to understand the different components of the FBD, and why/how they are drawn.

Let's try a practice problem together.

## Problem 1
{{< figure library="true" src="newton1.jpg" title="Problem 1" lightbox="true" >}}
Consider the mass that slides down a rough incline plane as shown. If M = 5.5kg, Ff = 11.7N, and θ = 30.

       a) Determine the normal force.
       b) Determine the acceleration.

Follow the steps listed above.

First, pick out the variables you have and the variables you need to find. We have our angle, the mass of the box, and the friction force. We are asked to find the normal force of the box and the acceleration. Next, draw your free body diagram. It should look like the image below.

Notice how the mgSinθ is directed in the horizontal direction and the mgCosθ is directed in the vertical direction. For inclined plane problems, the free-body diagrams switch the trigonometric signs so the sin points to the horizontal direction, and cosθ points to the vertical direction. Another thing to keep in mind is that mgSinθ will always be directed in the same direction as the bottom of the incline.

Now that you have a guide for the X and Y components, formulate two equations and set them both equal to ma.

Y Components: Fn - mgCosθ = ma

X Components: mgSinθ - Ff = ma

​

In the Y component Fn = mgCosθ

Plugin the variables you have and solve for the normal force.

Fn = + 46.679N

Since the box isn't moving up and down, acceleration in the Y component is 0. ( ma in the Y-component = 0)

To solve for the acceleration, use the X component formula.

Plugin the numbers from the problem into the equation and solve for acceleration.

a = - 2.762 m/s^2

Try these yourself

## Problem 2
A 2.5 kg mass is pushed up an incline at a constant speed by a 20N force. Determine the normal force.

   Fn = +22.716 N

If you didn't get this answer review your work and your FBD. Remember your FBD is the foundation for every problem! Read the problem carefully, the block is moving up this time, so the signs in your equation should reflect this.

​

## Problem 3
A block of mass m=5.8kg is pulled up at θ = 25 with a force of magnitude F = 32N. Find the acceleration of the block if the incline is frictionless.

   a = 1.3756 m/s^2

Let's look more into friction, as this is a concept that you should know well.

There are two types of friction: Kinetic friction and Static Friction.

## STATIC FRICTION
Static friction is the force that prevents an object from moving. For example, when two surfaces are not sliding against each other, there is static friction between them.

    How To Calculate Static Friction:

    Fs < = μs * Fn                
    
    Notice how Fs is written as an inequality.

The static coefficient μs is always greater than μk

## KINETIC FRICTION
Kinetic friction is the force that impedes the motion of an object that is already moving. For example, when two surfaces are sliding against each but there is a force slowing one down, there is kinetic friction between them.

    How To Calculate Kinetic Friction:

    Fk= μk * Fn                

    The kinetic coefficient μk is always less than μs
