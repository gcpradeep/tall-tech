Kinematics refers to the motion of objects and how they are moving. 
 
Kinematics is continuously seen throughout Physics, so I have included some examples to understand this concept better
- A train moving
- Water flowing down a river
- A tennis ball flying after being hit
- Jumping on a trampoline
- An airplane flying
